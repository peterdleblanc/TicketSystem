~ (10.19.07) -- Added shortcut keys to accessable fields.

~ (10.22.07) -- Added Problem Summary and Next Action fields.
~ (10.22.07) -- POSSIBLE CONCEPT -- The main interface is inside the div named "main". We could have a div called "login" and only show the main div when the login is complete.
